Query Selectors allow you to use CSS Selectors to Select HTML elements.
It is the new way in JS to Select HTML elements.

There are 2 such Selectors:
    1. querySelector(): It will return only the first occurence present in the given class/id of the CSS.
    2. querySelectorAll(): It will return all the occurences present in the given class/id of the CSS.
