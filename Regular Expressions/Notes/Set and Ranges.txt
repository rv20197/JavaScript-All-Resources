Set and ranges are represented by several characters inside square brackets [...].
This just means to search for any value among given values.
It has two variations:
- First, is to write it like this [ABC]. It means any of these 3 characters will be matched. This is called set.
    For example:
        String: Air Birm Circle.
        Pattern: [ABC]irm

- Second, square brackets may also contain character ranges. [A-Z] is a character in range from A to Z,
  and [0-9] is a digit from 0 to 9.
    For example:
        String: Same Name Fame Game
        Pattern: [A-Z]ame
