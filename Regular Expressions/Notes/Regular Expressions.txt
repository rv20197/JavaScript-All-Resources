A regular expression is an object that describes a pattern of characters.
It allows us to search for specific pattern of text using the defined patterns.

For example:
- To check whether a given string is valid email or not.
- To check that an entered username should only contain alphabets and numbers.

Syntax for regular expressions:
/pattern-string/flags

- (pattern-string) is where you define what strings this pattern should match.

- (/) represents the start and end of (pattern-string)

- (flags) are used to define whether you want the search to be case-sensitive or case-insensitive,
or whether you want just the first result of all the results.

Types of flags:
g : Returns all the matches (GLOBAL)
m : ^ and $ match start/end of line (MULTI LINE)
i : case insensitive
y : Proceed matching from where previous match ended only (STICKY)
u : Match with unicode (UNICODE)
s : Dot matches newline (SINGLE LINE)
