Regex in JavaScript:
To define regular expression in JavaScript there are two ways:
- First, is the one we have learnt so far.
    Syntax: /{pattern}/{flags}
- Second, is the inbuilt regular expression class.
 (ONLY USE WHEN PATTERN IS GENERATED DYNAMICALLY OR ENTERED BY USER)
    Syntax: new RegExp("pattern","flags")


Regex Methods in JavaScript:

- str.search(pattern): It returns the string position of the first match.
- pattern.test(str): It returns true if there is a match and returns false if there is no match.
- str.match(pattern): It returns the matched string. If the flag is not set to global then  it returns only the first match.
                      But if the flag is set to global then it returns an array of matches.

NOTE: (.) will match any characters
