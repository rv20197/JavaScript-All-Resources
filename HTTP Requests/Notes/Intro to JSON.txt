JSON stands for Javascript Onject Notation

It is basically a text format that makes it easy to share data between clients and servers. 
Its origin is based on how Javascript object works so that's why it looks like a Javascript object.

It is widely used across many languages like C, Ruby, Python, PHP etc.

NOTE: JSON CANNOT HOLD UNDEFINED OR FUNCTION 
        - JSON will just ignore the UNDEFINED/FUNCTION Key:Value Pair


It accepts :
- String
- Number
- object
- Boolean
- Null
