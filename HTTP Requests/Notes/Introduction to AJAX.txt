AJAX is a short form for the Asynchcronous JavaScript And XML. It allows web pages to be updated
asynchcronously by exchanging data with the backend. This makes it possible to update parts of webpage,
without reloading the whole page.

Initially AJAX was used to send and receive XML because that was how the data was received from the backend in old days.
But now it can also be used to send/receive JSON Objects, which is pretty common these days.

AJAX uses a browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object to make requests to the backend server.
This gave a simple and standard way to make HTTP requests from JavaScript to get content and update HTML page.
