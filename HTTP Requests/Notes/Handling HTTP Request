                    "readyState" Property
The XMLHTTPRequest object gives us access to another Property called readyState.
The readyState Property holds the status of the XMLHTTPRequest.

These are the available status for the request:
- UNSENT : It means  that the request has been initiated but open() not called yet. 
            It is represented by the value 0.

- OPENED : It means that open() has been called. It is represented by the value 1.

- HEADERS RECEIVED: It means that send() has been called. It is represented by the value 2.

- LOADING: It means that the request is being processed. It is represented by the value 3.

- DONE: It means that the request is completed and the response is ready. It is represented by the value 4.

                    "onreadystatechange" Property

The XMLHTTPRequest also gives us access to another Property called onreadystatechange.
The onreadystatechange Property defines a function to be executed when the readyState changes.
