Selectors and Filters provide a way of finding and extracting information from web page.

Selectors are used to select the HTML elements using CSS-like selectors.

For example:
$('p')
The above statement will select all the HTML elements with the
paragraph tag and will return it as a list of objects.

$('#topbar') : It will select html element with Id = topbar

$('header section'): This will select all the section elements in the header element


Filters are used to refine the results returned from the Selectors.

For example:
$('p:first')

This ":something" is a filter which selects the first paragraph returned by $('p') selector.
The above line of code can also be written like this: $('p').first()
