/* 
The Mechanism where variables and function can be used,
before declaring them is called Hoisting in JavaScript.
 
The variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code runs
 
JavaScript has two steps in execution:
   1. Creation
   2. Execution
   
By default the undefined is the value assigned to the variable if any value is not assigned
